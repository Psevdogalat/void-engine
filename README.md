My attempt to develop 2d game engine. Curren operating sistem - win10.
Tollchain - mingw-w64-x86-64 (msys2).

Make targets:

	game.exe  			- demo game on engine
	gjk_test.exe		- Gilbert — Johnson — Keerthi algorithm test
	raycast_test.exe	- test for raycast functionality
	test.exe			- common tests

Dependences:
	zlib-1.2.13			https://zlib.net/
	libpng-1.6.38		http://www.libpng.org

That's all for now.
